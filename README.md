# CMU 36-705 Intermediate Statistics Fall 2016 (Larry Wasserman)

The materials in this repo *used to be available* at the following link, but has now disappeared
due to the instructor updating the course page with new materials:

http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/

However, I have archived the course page from the Fall 2016 version of this course, which is accessible
below.

The videos that accompany the materials in this repo are available at:

The repo contains:

1) cmu-36-705-intermediate-statistics-fall-2016-course-page.html - an archived copy of coursepage
showing the lecture schedule, reading references etc. 

2) cmu-36-705-intermediate-statistics-fall-2016-syllabus - self-explanatory.

3) assignment-questions - contains the 10 problem sets that accompany the course*.

4) lecture-notes - contains 18 PDF lecture slides covering all the lecture videos.

5) practice-exams - contains 3 practice exams that are posted on the coursepage*.

6) completed-assignments - my own written solutions to the problem sets.

7) completed-practice-exams - my own written solutions to the practice exams.

Remarks:

homework-assignments - at the time of download, these links were all broken. These were
located at Studocu.com. It can be attested with a high degree of confidence that these 
are indeed the ones which were supposed to be available for download from the course page.

practice-exams - similarly downloaded from Studocu.com
