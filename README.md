# CMU 36-705 Intermediate Statistics Fall 2016 (Larry Wasserman)

The materials in this repo *used to be available* at the following link:

http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=stat705/

They are now no longer available due to the instructor updating the course page with new materials. However, I have **archived** the course page from the Fall 2016 version of this course, see item 1) below.

The videos that accompany the materials in this repo are available at:

For those looking to work through this course by themselves, this repo contains:

1) `cmu-36-705-intermediate-statistics-fall-2016-course-page.html` - an archived copy of coursepage
showing the lecture schedule, reading references etc. 

2) `cmu-36-705-intermediate-statistics-fall-2016-syllabus.pdf` - self-explanatory.

3) `/assignment-questions` - contains the 10 problem sets that accompany the course*.

4) `/lecture-notes` - contains 18 PDF lecture slides covering all the lecture videos.

5) `/practice-exams` - contains 3 practice exams that are posted on the coursepage*.

This repo also contains the work I produced whilst working through this by myself, such as completed assignments, completed practice exams, and my summaries of the learning objectives in each lecture.

6) `/completed-assignments` - my own written solutions to the problem sets.

7) `/completed-practice-exams` - my own written solutions to the practice exams.

8) `36-705-lecture-summaries.pdf` - my own summary of the material covered in each lecture, organised by the numbering of the PDF lecture notes, and the date of each Youtube lecture. Contains some further notes on completeness of the Youtube lectures (very occasionally some  lectures are missed/have segments missing).

Remarks:

`/assigment-questions` - at the time of download, the links to the PDDs were all broken. These were
located at Studocu.com. It can be attested with a high degree of confidence that these 
are indeed the ones which were supposed to be available for download from the course page, as they correspond to the questions instructor goes through on the board.

`/practice-exams` - similarly downloaded from Studocu.com
